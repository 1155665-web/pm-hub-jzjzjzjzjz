### Introduction

Hi ShopFast family!

February was huge! We launched guest checkout after hearing feedback from hundreds of customers. The results have exceeded our expectations. Here's everything you need to know.

---

## What We Shipped 📦

### Major Feature: Guest Checkout

**What it is:**
Customers can now complete purchases without creating an account. They can optionally create an account after purchase with one click.

**Why it matters:**
40% of cart abandonments were caused by registration requirements. This removes that friction while still offering account benefits.

**Key capabilities:**
- Checkout with just email, shipping, and payment
- Track orders via email confirmation link
- One-click account creation post-purchase
- All account features available once converted

**Impact so far:**
- Cart abandonment: Down from 40% to 32% ✅
- Checkout time: Down from 6 min to 2.8 min ✅
- Guest checkout adoption: 58% of all purchases ✅
- Guest-to-account conversion: 35% create accounts ✅

**Quality of life:**
