## Standup Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Start on time (don't wait for latecomers)  
✅ Stand up (keeps it short)  
✅ Keep to 15 minutes  
✅ Focus on the sprint goal  
✅ Address blockers immediately after  
✅ Use a timer  
✅ Take detailed discussions offline  

### DON'T:
❌ Let it turn into a status report to the PM  
❌ Solve problems during standup  
❌ Let one person dominate  
❌ Go into implementation details  
❌ Skip it (consistency matters)  
❌ Multi-task during standup  
❌ Read from Jira (talk about work, not tickets)  

---

## Common Standup Patterns

### Round Robin
- Go around in order
- Everyone gets equal time
- Simple and predictable

### Walking the Board
- Start with stories closest to done
- Focus on completing work
- Team discusses each story

### Yesterday/Today/Blockers
- Standard three questions
- Most common format
- Clear structure

---

## Handling Common Issues

### Issue: Standup runs too long
**Solutions:**
- Set a timer
- Park discussions for after
- Walking the board instead of round robin
- Scrum master enforces time box

### Issue: Team member rambling
**Solutions:**
- Gentle time reminder
- Focus on outcomes, not tasks
- "Let's take that offline"
- One-on-one coaching

### Issue: No blockers ever mentioned
**Solutions:**
- Create safe environment
- Ask directly: "What's slowing you down?"
- Follow up one-on-one
- Look for hidden blockers

### Issue: Feels like status report to PM/manager
**Solutions:**
- Emphasize it's for the team
- PM stays quiet, just listens
- Team members face each other, not PM
- Change facilitation

### Issue: Remote team engagement
**Solutions:**
- Use video (cameras on)
- Rotate who goes first
- Use virtual board
- Keep energy high

---

## Virtual Standup Tips

**Technology:**
- Video calls (cameras on)
- Screen share sprint board
- Use chat for parking lot items
- Record for async team members

**Engagement:**
- Start with quick personal check-in
- Use reactions/emojis
- Rotate facilitator
- Keep it interactive

**Async Options:**
- Written updates in Slack
- Video recording updates
- Thread-based updates
- Still have live standup 2-3x/week

---

## Standup Variations

### 15-Minute Rule
If standup goes over 15 min, move remaining people to after-standup discussion

### Blocker-First
Start by asking "Any blockers?" so PM can start resolving immediately

### Focus Days
Monday: Sprint goal alignment  
Wednesday: Mid-sprint check  
Friday: Week wrap-up

### Themed Days
- Monday: What's exciting this week?
- Friday: What did we learn?
